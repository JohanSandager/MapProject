## Instructions

To run the map, navigate to the folder "Map" in the terminal, and use "./gradlew run" (".\gradlew" run for windows).

These different option can be selected insinde the promt openign efter clicking the "Choose file" button. ".osm" files can be found at [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/55.67245/12.59411)
Else it is possible to load our default binary file.

**Hint:** To see all you might need to maximize the screen! (Nearest road, zoom level & fps is at the bottom of the search part of the window)

To move around use two fingers on the trackpad, and drag them around. Zoom can be done using the zoom-gesture, aswell as uisng the buttons.
